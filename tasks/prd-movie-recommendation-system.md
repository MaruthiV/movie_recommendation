# Product Requirements Document: Movie Recommendation System

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent platform designed to solve the core problem of users struggling to find movies they'll actually enjoy watching. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques including graph neural networks, sequential transformers, and multi-modal embeddings to provide highly personalized movie recommendations that match users' tastes while also encouraging discovery of new content.

**Problem Statement**: Users often waste time browsing through thousands of movies without finding content that matches their preferences, leading to poor user experience and decreased engagement.

**Goal**: Create a recommendation system that accurately predicts user preferences, handles new users gracefully, promotes content diversity, and provides explainable recommendations in real-time.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Accuracy & Relevance**: Achieve >70% movie completion rate for recommended content
2. **Fresh-Start Coverage**: Provide relevant recommendations to new users within their first interaction
3. **Serendipity & Diversity**: Ensure >30% of recommendations introduce users to new content outside their usual preferences
4. **Explainability**: Achieve >80% user satisfaction with recommendation explanations
5. **Real-time Performance**: Maintain <100ms end-to-end recommendation latency
6. **User Engagement**: Increase overall user engagement by 20%

### Secondary Goals
- Scale to handle tens of millions of users
- Process TB-PB scale data efficiently
- Maintain user privacy while providing personalized recommendations
- Support multiple device types (TV, mobile, web)

## 3. User Stories

### Core User Stories
1. **As a new user**, I want to input a movie I like and immediately receive a list of similar movies I would enjoy, so I can start discovering content without extensive setup.

2. **As a returning user**, I want the system to remember my preferences and provide increasingly personalized recommendations, so I can find content that matches my evolving tastes.

3. **As an explorer**, I want to discover diverse content outside my usual preferences, so I can expand my movie horizons and find hidden gems.

4. **As a power user**, I want to understand why specific movies are recommended to me, so I can trust the system and provide better feedback.

5. **As any user**, I want to search for movies using natural language queries, so I can find content based on mood, themes, or specific criteria.

### Edge Case User Stories
6. **As a user with no viewing history**, I want to receive relevant recommendations based on popular content and basic preferences, so I don't feel overwhelmed by choice.

7. **As a user who watches diverse genres**, I want recommendations that respect my eclectic taste while still providing focused suggestions, so I can find content that matches my current mood.
