### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- ML model training scripts should be run in isolated environments with GPU support.
- Database migrations should be version-controlled and tested in staging environments.
- Performance tests should be run against production-like environments.
